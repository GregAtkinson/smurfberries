php will automatticly end sessions after a timeout period however we want to 
end sessions after a logout or a user deletion.

we also want to keep our data sets small and simple where possible.

There is a neeed to periodically clean out the sql database of data that was 
generated but no longer has any relivance.

The data of concern is in the session and login attempt tables.

we want to delete all records relating to a user_id when a user is deleted.
This is achived using mysql instead of php. any tables that store user spacific 
information that should be deleted with the user are linked using FOREIGN KEY 
and ON CASCADE DELETE options.

finally we want to delete data from the database that is only relivant for a 
time period that has expired this is achived by using the garbageCollector 
function which is called by the db start function (which is called by every page).
