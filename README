Smurfberries aims to develop a php based framework for building "cyber"
capture the flag games.

Q: why is it called smurfberries?
A: I'm not normally very creative and when coding if I dont have a theme to work with 
   everything tends to get called boobies which is fine for my own code but not for 
   something I intend to share.

Smurfberries is intended to be interacted with by people who know how to "hack" and
is open source. As such it needs to have well written, well maintained, well documented
and security focused code.

Smurfberries is written for using on php5.3+ and utilizes a mysql backend.

additional Documentation will be available in the doc folder.
